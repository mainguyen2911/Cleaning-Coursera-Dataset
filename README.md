# Cleaning-Coursera-Dataset
This project focuses on the cleaning process. The raw dataset can be found here at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinrustam/coursera-dataset?select=CourseraDataset-Unclean.csv).

This repository includes:
* **README.md**
* **Data Cleaning - CourseraDataset.ipynb**: the Jupiter Notebook file that includes all codes of the cleaning process.
* **CourseraDataset-Clean.csv**: the cleaned dataset produced from the cleaning process.

During this cleaning process, I was able to:
* Remove 900 duplicated values.
* Convert text fields *Duration* and *Review* into numbers for further analysis.
* Clean text fields that were displayed as lists initially.
